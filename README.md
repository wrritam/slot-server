## Features

- TypeScript-based backend for type safety.
- MongoDB for database schema management and migrations.
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Node.js environment with Express for handling requests.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side programming.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to build APIs.
- **TypeScript**: The superset of JavaScript provides static typing.
- **MongoDB**: For database operations
- **Nodemon**: Tool for automatically restarting the server during development.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wrritam/slot-server.git
   cd slot-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment-specific variables.
   ```bash
   PORT
   MONGODB_URI

6. **Start the local Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev

This will start the server on the port specified in your environment variables and automatically reload on file changes.

## Note to the Project Reviewer

The 'justjoshdevs' github profile is my another profile. I had to use a separate account for a freelance project to work with other devs that's why it's in my machine. You can see my name in the below screenshot.
